#Welcome to UXLR

UXLR is a simple tool that looks through your XAML files and tries to help you clean it up. Currently it can do two things:  
- If you are doing [string localisation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh965326.aspx) it will be able to find strings which are defined but are not used.
- If you are using styles, it can find unused styles.
